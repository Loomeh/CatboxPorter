## FAQ
**Q. Why are my uploads failing?**  
A. Catbox imposes a limit of 200MB for anonymous/non-supporting uploaders so make sure your file isn't over 200MB  
  
**Q. Why can't other people see my embedded videos**  
A. [A few countries and ISPs block or restrict access to Catbox servers](https://catbox.moe/faq.php). There's not much you can do about this, just keep this in mind when you're sharing videos.  

**Q. What happened to my file's name?**  
A. Catbox randomises the file name of any file that gets uploaded to their servers. There's nothing you can do about this. If your file name is important, consider placing your file inside a compressed archive.  

**Q. How do I uninstall Catbox Porter?**  
A. Navigate to ```%LocalAppData%\Programs\CatboxPorter\``` and run `unins000.exe`. This will get rid of Catbox Porter completely.  
  
**Q. Is Linux support coming?**  
A. Probably not.  

**Q. Why does your logo look so bad?**  
A. I needed a logo for the context menu and I'm not very good at drawing so I came up with this simple blue cat dude. I think he's cool.  

**Q. What does the name mean?**  
A. It's a reference to porters from Death Stranding.
###### I'm not very good at naming things...
